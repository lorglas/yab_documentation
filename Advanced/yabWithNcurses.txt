Several commands require ncurses compiled in to work. These are all related to terminal functions. If one needs to run a terminal app that uses these functions one needs to re-compile yab. 

Compiling yab with ncurses

1 change src/global.h line 1

from :

//define BUILD_NCURSES

to: 

#define BUILD_NCURSES

2  change src/makefile line 92 

from:

LIB = -lbe -lroot -ltranslation -ltracker -lmedia  

to:

LIB = -lbe -lroot -ltranslation -ltracker -lmedia  -lncurses

3 install ncurses and ncurses devel


4
run make in the src directory

NOTE:

An ncurses enabled  version of yab and libyab.so are not compatible with the standard version and may break working apps if installed.
