Name:
ceil()  compute the ceiling for its (float) argument

Synopsis: 
print ceil(x)

Description:
The ceil-function returns the smallest integer number, that is larger or equal than its argument.

Example:
print ceil(1.5),floor(1.5)
print ceil(2),floor(2)

Explanation:

Comparing functions ceil and floor, gives a first line of output (1 2), showing that ceil is less or equal than floor; but as the second line of output (2 2) shows, the two functions give equal results for integer arguments.
