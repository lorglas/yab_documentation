Name:
compile  compile a string with yabasic-code on the fly

Synopsis:
compile(code$)

Description:
This is an advanced command (closely related with the execute-command). It allows you to compile a string of yabasic-code (which is the only argument). Afterwards the compiled code is a normal part of your program.

Note, that there is no way to remove the compiled code.

Example:

compile("sub mysub(a):print a:end sub")
mysub(2)
          
This example creates a function named mysub, which simply prints its single argument.
