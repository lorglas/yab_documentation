Name:
execute()  execute a user defined subroutine, which must return a number

Synopsis:
print execute("bar","arg1","arg2")

Description:

The execute-function is the counterpart of the execute$-function (please see there for some caveats). execute may be used to execute subroutines, which return a number.

Example:

print execute("bar",2,3)
sub bar(a,b)
  return a+b
end sub
            
This example would print out 5.
